TL;DR: We designed a novel multi-agent actor-critic reinforcement framework for partially observable multi-agent path finding. We integrated the heuristic-based attention mechanisms to enable the learned model to generalize among multiple instances on a large scale.

*Qiushi Lin*, Hang Ma\n
Preprint (In Submission) [https://qiushi-Lin.github.io/documents/lin2023mfceq.pdf \[pdf\]] [https://github.com/Qiushi-Lin/MFCEQ \[code\]]\n
TL;DR: We proposed an adaptable multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that combines mean field control and envelop Q-learning for moving agents in formation, and provided theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation.
